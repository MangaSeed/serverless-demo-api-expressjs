# Serverless Demo Api Express Js

A project forked from https://github.com/AnomalyInnovations/serverless-stack-demo-api,   
It follows 
[Serverless Stack](https://serverless-stack.com) a free comprehensive guide for creating 
full-stack serverless   
applications but with different stack it used express js and typescript.
